</p>

---

**AnalystCollective** is not a black-box stock recommender. It is a **transparent,
AI agent-driven valuation engine** — you see not just what a company is "worth",
but how the story unfolds under every assumption, and what the gap between price
and value actually means.

Built on Aswath Damodaran's six-layer valuation framework, it turns methodology
into runnable Python code, orchestrated through **14 independent AI sub-agents**
in a self-iterating pipeline with adversarial review at every step. Every number
is auditable. Every report is reproducible.

---

## What's Inside

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **Valuation Engine** (`scripts/`) | 10 Python programs — DCF, Monte Carlo, reverse DCF, breakeven, SOTP, comps, financials, charts, linting, data fetching |
| **Methodology** (`references/`) | The six-layer Damodaran framework + input estimation + valuation lenses + analyst playbook |
| **Archetype Playbooks** | Per-company-type guides — growth, banks/insurers, cyclicals/commodities, pre-profit/young, mature/declining, holding companies |
| **Templates** (`templates/`) | Worked examples — NVIDIA ($240 intrinsic, Jun 2023), Tencent SOTP, Freeport-McMoRan, plus blank assumption sheets |
| **Tests** (`tests/`) | Reproducibility guard, output schema validation, report linter, archetype coverage |
| **Style Guide** | Investor-facing prose discipline — no second-person, no emoji, long-form argument, MoS buy-band, numbers ledger |

## Modular Architecture — Agent Team + Adversarial Review

The skill is decomposed into **14 sub-skills** orchestrated through a pipeline with
two powerful mechanisms:

### Mechanism 1 — Default Agent Team (Parallelism)

Where sub-skills are independent, the orchestrator **automatically spawns parallel
agents** — no manual instruction needed. This cuts wall-clock time significantly:

```
WAVE 1 (parallel)  → /analyze-industry ∥ /analyze-theme
WAVE 2             → /analyze-company
WAVE 3             → /build-assumptions
WAVE 4             → /run-valuation
WAVE 5 (parallel)  → /durability-check ∥ /triangulate
WAVE 6             → /write-report
WAVE 7             → /self-audit
WAVE 8             → /generate-pdf
```

### Mechanism 2 — Adversarial Review at Every Step

After **EVERY** sub-skill completes, an adversarial review agent critiques the
output before the pipeline can proceed. The reviewer's stance is **skeptical,

### Mechanism 3 — Loop Protocol (Type-A/B Gates + Cross-Model Verdict)

Every gate is classified Type-A (machine-checkable) or Type-B (requires taste).
**Type-B gates route to a different model family (Codex xhigh)** — Claude drives
the loop but a different model signs off on quality. A convergence terminator
caps iterations at 3, escalating to risk annotation instead of silent pass.
Full protocol: [`references/loop-protocol.md`](references/loop-protocol.md).

| Gate Type | Examples | Reviewer | Rule |
|-----------|----------|----------|------|
| **Type-A** | `report_lint.py`, JSON validity, engine sanity, terminal growth ≤ riskfree | Same-model / script | Self-judgment OK |
| **Type-B** | 7-dim audit, report voice/depth, adversarial reviews | **Cross-model (Codex xhigh)** | Cannot self-acquit |

> *"A loop can DRIVE; it cannot ACQUIT."* — Claude orchestrates; a different model
> family verifies. 5 Claude reviewers agreeing = shared bias, not correctness.

After **EVERY** sub-skill completes, an adversarial review agent critiques the
output before the pipeline can proceed. The reviewer's stance is **skeptical,
not friendly** — it must find at least one weakness or prove the output is
genuinely flawless. Each sub-skill gets **1–2 revision rounds**:

```
sub-skill → output → adversarial review → REVISE?
    ↑                                        │
    └── fix + re-submit (round 2) ───────────┘
                                                 ↓
                                            REVISE again?
                                                 │
                                    ┌────────────┴────────────┐
                                    ↓                         ↓
                                  PASS                    ESCALATE
                              (next step)           (flag with risk note)
```

Each sub-skill has a specific review criteria section in its SKILL.md —
the reviewer checks against a concrete checklist, not vague impressions.

### All sub-skills

| Sub-skill | Role | Key review check |
|-----------|------|-----------------|
| `/classify-archetype` | Pick engine + playbook | Financials trap avoided? Edge cases considered? |
| `/analyze-industry` | Lifecycle, cycles, leaders | 10+ yr data? Leader rotation table real? |
| `/analyze-company` | Model, moat, 10yr, drawdowns | Moat decomposed? Drawdowns documented? SBC quantified? |
| `/analyze-theme` | TAM × share, competition | Two revenue paths? TAM sourced? Big Market Delusion? |
| `/build-assumptions` | Story→numbers, .json | Accounting computed? Drivers justified? Engine sanity? |
| `/run-valuation` | DCF, MC, breakeven, reverse | All scripts run? Terminal % stated? MoS band? |
| `/durability-check` | ROIC-WACC, CAP, RONIC | ROIC adjusted? Each moat has threat? CAP justified? |
| `/triangulate` | 7-lens cross-check | No averaging? Dispute locus specific? Variant falsifiable? |
| `/write-report` | Investor-facing prose | No "you"? All 6 depth elements? Numbers ledger? |
| `/self-audit` | Lint + self-critique | Lint passes? No dodged CRITICALs? Honest scoring? |
| `/generate-pdf` | Typographic PDF | Charts embedded? CJK fonts render? Rating box prominent? |
| `/critique-report` | Mode B: audit others | Evidence-backed? Re-run present? Verdict matches? |
| `/refresh-valuation` | Mode C: keep current | Dated sweep? Driver delta explicit? Reverse re-test? |
| `/fetch-data` | Shared: data skeleton | Sources annotated? Tiers correct? Warnings present? |

Each sub-skill is independently invocable and optimizable — change one review
criteria, improve one prompt, and the pipeline benefits without touching the rest.

## Philosophy

> *"A valuation is a story disciplined by numbers. A story without numbers is a
> fairy tale; numbers without a story are a spreadsheet nobody believes."*
> — Aswath Damodaran

Every valuation traces to a narrative, and every narrative is stress-tested
with a distribution, not a point estimate. The engine enforces a handful of
non-negotiable disciplines:

- **Story → numbers → value.** Never a spreadsheet without a narrative, never a narrative without numbers.
- **Quantify uncertainty; don't hide behind it.** Monte Carlo over the key drivers. Output a distribution.
- **Robustness over precision.** A conclusion that flips on a 2% tweak isn't one.
- **Separate investing from trading.** Value closes the price–value gap; momentum is a different game.
- **Be honest about bias.** Disclose priors, data dates, and the numbers ledger.

## Quick Start

```bash
# Clone
git clone https://github.com/Alyosha28/equity-research-analyst.git
cd equity-research-analyst

# Reproduce the NVIDIA valuation (Damodaran, June 2023)
cd scripts
python dcf_valuation.py ../templates/assumptions.example.json
# → intrinsic value ≈ $236/share

# Run the Monte Carlo
python monte_carlo.py ../templates/assumptions.example.json --price 409 --trials 20000
# → price at ~94th percentile, P(undervalued) ≈ 5%

# What does the price imply?
python reverse_dcf.py ../templates/assumptions.example.json --price 409 --solve-for terminal_revenue
# → $409 price implies ~$489B year-10 revenue (83% above base case)

# Generate charts for your report
python monte_carlo.py ../templates/assumptions.example.json --price 409 --json > mc.json
python charts.py --kind montecarlo --in mc.json --out figs/

# Value your own company
cp ../templates/assumptions.example.json ../my_company.json
# Edit my_company.json with your estimates
python dcf_valuation.py ../my_company.json
```

No dependencies beyond Python 3.10+ and the standard library for the core
engine. Optional: `matplotlib` for chart generation.

## The Engine

All scripts consume a JSON assumptions sheet. Money is in **$ millions**, rates
are **decimals** (0.40 = 40%), shares in **millions**. Every valuation script
accepts `--json` for machine-readable output, composable with `charts.py`.

| Script | Lens | Output |
|--------|------|--------|
| `dcf_valuation.py` | Intrinsic DCF | value/share, FCFF schedule, terminal-value share |
| `monte_carlo.py` | Uncertainty | value distribution, percentiles, **margin-of-safety buy-band**, price percentile |
| `breakeven.py` | "What has to be true" | 2-variable table (revenue × margin) |
| `reverse_dcf.py` | Expectations investing | growth / margin / CoC the price implies |
| `sotp.py` | Sum-of-the-parts | core DCF + portfolio + net cash → per share |
| `comps.py` | Relative valuation | peer-median multiples → implied value |
| `financial_valuation.py` | Banks & insurers | excess-return `(ROE − Ke) × BV` + DDM cross-check |
| `charts.py` | Visualization | Monte Carlo histogram, football field, breakeven heatmap, tornado → PNG/SVG |
| `report_lint.py` | Quality gate | flags AI-answer tells: second-person, emoji, missing MoS/ledger/disclaimer |
| `fetch_financials.py` | Data pre-fill | yfinance/EDGAR → assumptions skeleton *(third-party tier — confirm before use)* |

### The Four Value Drivers

Every valuation reduces to four inputs, all built from the story:

1. **Revenue growth** — segment TAM × market share, declining toward the risk-free rate
2. **Target operating margin** — R&D-adjusted, with a convergence path
3. **Reinvestment efficiency** — sales-to-capital ratio (revenue produced per dollar invested)
4. **Cost of capital** — starting at the sector rate, gliding to mature-market levels

## Company Archetypes

Most companies fit the default FCFF frame. Five types do **not** — each has its
own engine and playbook:

| Archetype | Engine | Key Idea | Example |
|-----------|--------|----------|---------|
| **Growth / Mature** (default) | `dcf_valuation.py` | FCFF, four-driver spine | NVIDIA, most operating cos |
| **Financials** (banks, insurers) | `financial_valuation.py` | Excess-return on equity `(ROE − Ke) × BV` | Large banks, P&C insurers |
| **Cyclicals / Commodities** | `dcf_valuation.py` | FCFF on **normalized** mid-cycle inputs + price deck | Freeport-McMoRan, oil producers |
| **Pre-profit / Young** | `dcf_valuation.py` | FCFF + **failure branch** + margin path | Biotech, early SaaS |
| **Mature / Declining** | `dcf_valuation.py` | FCFF, low/neg growth, near-term cash dominates | Tobacco, legacy media |
| **Holding Companies** | `sotp.py` | Core DCF + portfolio mark-to-market + net cash | Tencent, SoftBank, conglomerates |

## Worked Example — NVIDIA (June 2023)

A faithful reconstruction of Damodaran's public NVDA valuation at ~$409/share:

```
Intrinsic value ≈ $236–240/share
Price at ~94th percentile of value distribution
P(undervalued) ≈ 5%
Rating: REDUCE
```

The engine reproduces the number, the distribution, and the decision. See
`templates/report.example.md` for the full research report.

## Triangulation — Seven Lenses

No single lens is enough. The framework triangulates across seven perspectives
and instructs: **tell me where they agree vs. disagree — the dispute locus is
where the real diligence belongs.**

| Lens | What it answers | Engine script |
|------|-----------------|---------------|
| 1. Intrinsic DCF | What is the company worth? | `dcf_valuation.py` |
| 2. Monte Carlo | How wide is the uncertainty? | `monte_carlo.py` |
| 3. Breakeven | What has to be true for this price? | `breakeven.py` |
| 4. Reverse DCF | What does the price already price in? | `reverse_dcf.py` |
| 5. Comps | What do peers imply? | `comps.py` |
| 6. SOTP | What are the pieces worth separately? | `sotp.py` |
| 7. Bear / Skeptic | How does this break? | *structured checklist* |

## Report Quality Gate

Every report must survive its own author's audit before publication:

```bash
python report_lint.py ../path/report.md          # quick check
python report_lint.py ../path/report.md --strict  # fresh report — zero tolerance
```

The linter catches: second-person address ("you"), emoji, banned callout
patterns, missing margin-of-safety band, missing numbers ledger, missing
disclaimer, and AI-answer sentence patterns. Additionally, self-apply the
seven-dimension Mode B critique rubric from `references/report-critique-rubric.md`.

## Guardrails

- This is **analysis, not personalized investment advice.** Always include a disclosure.
- State assumptions *as assumptions*, with basis and low/base/high ranges.
- Always report what **% of value sits in the terminal** and where the **price sits in the value distribution.**
- Quote a **margin-of-safety buy-band** (accumulate-below / fair / rich-above), not just a point.
- Make the **bear case** as rigorously as the bull case.
- **Self-falsify.** Name the specific assumption that carries the result and the breakeven at which the thesis flips.
- Note data dates. Stale inputs are how good methods produce bad calls.
- **Tier data confidence.** Distinguish audited figures, management guidance, sell-side consensus, third-party aggregators, and own estimates.

## Credits

Built on the public valuation methodology of **Aswath Damodaran** (NYU Stern),
whose blog *Musings on Markets* and open-source spreadsheets have taught a
generation of investors how to value companies. This project adapts his
six-layer framework into a reproducible, scriptable form.

Also incorporates techniques from:
- Mauboussin & Rappaport — *Expectations Investing* (reverse DCF, implied forecast period)
- SemiAnalysis — bottoms-up supply-chain modelling (capacity ceiling → units × ASP)
- Sell-side consensus methodology — segment build → EPS → multiple decomposition
- Buffett / Munger — owner-earnings, margin-of-safety, moat-durability discipline
- Dalio — cycle placement for cyclicals/commodities
